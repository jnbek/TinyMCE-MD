TinyMCE-MD
==========

Simple TinyMCE to Markdown webapp written in Perl, yes Perl...

Probably not something to use on Production HTML yet.

Requirements:
* Perl 5.8.X but 5.12.X is recommended
* HTML::WikiConverter::Markdown;
* HTML::WikiConverter;
* CGI::Ex::App;
* Template::Alloy;

And maybe CSS::Minify::XS and Javascript::Minify::XS.. but maybe not.
